# The codegen.yml file is a configuration file used by tools like GraphQL Code Generator to generate TypeScript code based on your GraphQL schema and query documents.
# This configuration is set up to generate TypeScript code for a GraphQL API, including types, operations, and client-side code to interact with the API using the graphql-request library. The Date scalar is explicitly mapped to the TypeScript string type.
